# Gemstone_price-application-Project Description: Machine Learning for Gemstone Price Prediction
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project designed to predict the prices of gemstones based on various features. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and deployment of a predictive model using a Streamlit application for easy and interactive user access.

Objectives
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and clean a comprehensive dataset of gemstones with features such as type, carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the distribution and relationships of features in the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Create new features and transform existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Development: Develop, train, and evaluate various machine learning models to predict gemstone prices.
Streamlit Application: Build and deploy an interactive Streamlit application that allows users to input gemstone features and obtain price predictions.
